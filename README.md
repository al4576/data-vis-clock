# Clock Data Visualization (a0)

This is a clock made for [Intro to Data Visualization](https://datavis.cs.columbia.edu/2026s_w4995/). The assignment asked for a 'creative interpretation of the clock, focused on aesthetics and inventiveness... Your interpretation needs to be legible enough that your reader can visually distinguish which is the hour, the minute, vs. the second; otherwise your reader should be able to guess the time within a quarter-hour of accuracy.'

The upper half of the circle represents 6AM-6PM, thus, the lower half represents 6PM-6AM.
The sun and moon in each half roughly show the hour within those periods (following the previous logic, the very bottom is midnight and the very top is noon). The number of mountains mountains aligns with the discretized hour, corresponding to the time in the 12-hour clock system.
Each arc of dots ('stars') on the opposing side of the circle from the sun/moon represents 15 minutes (a quarter hour), with each dot representing a minute.
The alien takes a step per second around the whole circle, reaching the top every new minute.
